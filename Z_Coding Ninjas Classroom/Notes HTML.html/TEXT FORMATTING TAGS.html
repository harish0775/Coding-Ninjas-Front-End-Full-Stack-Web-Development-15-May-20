      ●  HTML provides us with the ability for formatting text just like 
           we do it in MS Word or any text editing software. 
      
      ●  The following HTML tags are used to format the appearance of the text on your web page.

      ●  This can jazz up the look of the web page, however, too much variety in the text formatting
              can also look displeasing.
     
      ●  HTML also defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning. 

               HTML uses elements 

                      like <b> and <i> for formatting output, like bold or italic text. 

      ● Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:


				● <b> - defines bold text

				● <em> - defines emphasized text

				● <i> - defines italic text

				● <small> - defines smaller text

				● <strong> - defines important text

				● <sub> - defines subscripted text

				● <sup> - defines superscripted text

				● <u> - defines underlined text

				● <ins> - defines inserted text by underlying the text

				● <del> - defines deleted text by striking through the text

				● <s> - defines text that is no longer correct, accurate or relevant by striking through it.

				● <mark> - defines marked/highlighted text

				● <pre> - defines preformatted text which is presented exactly as written in HTML

				● <tt> - defines text appears as typed by a typewriter

				● <code> - defines piece of computer code

				● <q> - defines short quoted text

				● <cite> - defines reference to a cited work

				● <abbr> - defines an abbreviation or acronym

				● <var> - defines a variable name

				● <kbd> - defines keyboard input

				● <samp> - defines sample output from a computer program
