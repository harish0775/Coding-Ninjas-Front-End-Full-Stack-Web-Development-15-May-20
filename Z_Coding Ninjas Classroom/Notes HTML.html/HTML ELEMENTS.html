                                 <HTML ELEMENTS>




       ➢  Elements are the things that actually make up the web page.

       ➢  Tags just define the beginning and end of the elements. 

       ➢  Everything that a web page includes is an HTML element. 
            ● Eg: this is an HTML element: <b>This text is bold</b>


       ➢ The HTML element starts with a opening tag: <b>

       ➢ The content of the HTML element is: This text is bold

       ➢ The HTML element ends with an closing tag: </b>

                      

                       <The basic elements used till now have been briefly described below:>


                       ● Paragraphs

									➢ Paragraphs are blocks of text separated from each other by some space. 

									➢ They are defined using the <p> and </p> tags. 

									➢ When p element ends, the next element appears in next line. 

									        Eg: here's a sample of code for <p> tag


									<!DOCTYPE html>
									<html>
									<head>
									<title>p tag</title>
									</head>
									<body>

									<p>This is line 1.</p>
									<p>This is line 2.</p>

									<!-- trying to format the text without using p-tag -->
									This is line 1.
									This is line 2.
									This is line 3.
									</body>
									</html>

									It appears on a web browser like this:

									NOTE:  When formatting without p-tag, new lines are appended on the current line. 

									This happens because the spacing of text doesn’t matter to the browser.


				  ● Headings

									These are tags in HTML to mark some content as headings.
									In fact, there are six different levels of headings h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.

									  Among them h1 defines thelargest heading and h6 defines the smallest level heading. 
									  Eg: here's a sample of code for H tags

											<!DOCTYPE html>
											<html>
											<head>
											<title>Heading Levels</title>
											</head>
											<body>
											<h1>Heading level 1</h1>
											<h2>Heading level 2</h2>
											<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
											<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
											<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
											<h6>Heading level 6</h6>
											</body>
											</html>




                           ●  <br>tag


							               ➢  <br> tag is used to introduce a single line break between the contents. 

							               ➢   This means that when this tag is used in between a single line, 

							               ➢  the content after this tag will move to the next line.

							               ➢   Do not use it to provide space between block of elements
							                  ( eg.,  paragraph and heading)
