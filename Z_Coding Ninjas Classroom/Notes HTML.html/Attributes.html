<ATTRIBUTES>


Attributes   can provide additional information about the HTML elements on your page and
control their behaviour. Eg: <tag_name attribute_name="value_value">Content Enclosed</tag_name>. Some points to remember:

i. Attributes always come in name/value pairs like this: attribute_name="value".

ii. Attributes are always added to the start tag of an HTML element.

iii. Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes. Double style quotes (“ ”) are the
most common,<but single style quotes (‘ ’)are also allowed.>

iv. In some rare situations, like when the attribute value itself contains quotes, it is
necessary to use single quotes: name='John "ShotGun" Nelson' and vice-versa.

        Standard attributes are also known as global attributes, and function with a large number of elements. They include the basic standard attributes: these include accesskey, class, contenteditable, contextmenu, data, dir, hidden, id, lang, style, tabindex, title.
