                               <LISTS>


               ➢  Lists are used to group together related pieces of information so 
                                they are clearly associated with each other and easy to read. 

               ➢  Lists are good from a structural point of view as they help create a well-structured

               ➢  more accessible, easy to maintain document. 

               ➢  HTML supports  ordered, unordered  and definition lists.




                     -: There two type of list in html:-



                           ● Unordered Lists

                               ➢ It is used to group a set of related items in no particular order. 

                               ➢ Unordered lists are used when the numbering of items is not required. 
                                     
                               ➢  By default the items are followed by bullets. 

                               ➢  They are defined using the <ul> tag. Eg:
													
													<!DOCTYPE html>
													<html>
													 <head>
													<title>Unordered Lists</title>
													</head>
													<body>
													<h1>Lists</h1>
													<ul>
													<li>first item</li>
													<li>second item</li>
													<li>third item</li>
													</ul>
													</body>
													</html>


											-: The output is as follows:

											➢  HTML provides an interesting feature to change the style of the  list item marker. 



							    ■ There are 4 types of style in unordered lists:


											● type="disc" - sets the list item marker to a bullet (default)

											○ type="circle" - sets the list item marker to a circle

											■ type="square" - sets the list item marker to a square

											   type="none" - the lists items will not be marked

								      NOTE:

  
								          The above styles can be produced by using the 'type' attribute. 

											However, this attribute is now not supported in HTML5 
											and you now need to change the style using CSS.



				        ● Ordered Lists


					        ➢ It is used to group a set of related items in a specific order.

					        ➢  Ordered lists are used when the numbering of items is required. 

					        ➢ By default the items are followed by  numerical numbering. 

					              They are defined using the <ul> tag.


					               Eg:
										<!DOCTYPE html>
										<html>
										<head>
										<title>Unordered Lists</title>
										</head>
										<body>
										<h1>Lists</h1>
										<ol>
										<li>first item</li>
										<li>second item</li>
										<li>third item</li>
										</ol>
										</body>
										</html>


					


							      ➢ Similarly,like the unordered lists.

									

					    	-: There are also different types of ways to number


									➢ the ordered lists using the 'type' attribute:


									1. type="1" - The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)

									A. type="A" - The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters

									a. type="a" - The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters

									I. type="I" - The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers

									i. type="i" - The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers
									Now, what if you want to change the starting numbering of the lists?

									HTML has got the solution for it: the 'start' attribute. So, 

									if we change <ol> to <ol start="7" >, you will now see the output as:

                                              
                                              if we write <ol> this mean order start from by Default "1";
                                              	  but in case you to start as you want. <ol start="7" >

                                              	  	order start form "7" in order;

                   



                       ●  Description Lists                        

		                                     
					             A definition list is not a list of items.

					              This is a list of terms and explanation of the terms.

					                 A definition list starts with the <dl> tag. Each definition - list term starts with the <dt> tag. 

					                 	 Each definition - list definition starts with the <dd> tag.


								Description lists are very specific in use as compared 
								     to ordered and unordered lists and hence are very less used.

								 But whenever, a structure like a list of terms and their description is required,the description lists are the the perfect elements.
											 Eg:
													<!DOCTYPE html>
													<html>
													<head>
													<title>Description Lists</title>
													</head>
													<body>
													<h2>Description List</h2>
													<dl>
													<dt>Coffee</dt>
													<dd>- black hot drink</dd>
													<dt>Milk</dt>
													<dd>- white cold drink</dd>
													</dl>
													</body>
													</html>
