               The multimedia is a different content than text that 

                      uses 

                          sound,

                          music, 

                          videos, 

                          movies,

                          animations
                                           , etc. on the web.



             Multimedia is represented in multiple forms(eg., video, audio) and in multiple formats
             (eg., mp3, .avi).

              We can add audio, video and figures with the help of HTML media elements.



    -----:Audio and Video Element:-----

                 ● HTML can embed audios and videos directly in a web page without any external support. 

                 ● You can add audios and videos in a standard way. 

                 ● The <audio> element is used to add audio in web page. 

                 ● The <video> element is used to add video in web page. 

                 ● These elements are not sufficient to add the media. 

                 ● We need to control the media as well. 

                 ● there are several tags and attributes that are required to fully add the media. 

                ● The <audio> and <video> are same in the way the content is added to it and only tag name 
                	is different. 

                    	  Eg. 

                    	  to add audio to the web page, we use the following code:
										
										<audio controls>
										<source src="cn.avi" type="audio/avi">
										<source src="cn.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
										Your browser does not support the audio element.
										</audio>
						Here,

							 multiple source tags are used so that the audio plays if any one of the format
							is supported by the browser. Else, the text message will be shown. 


						-----:controls Attribute:---

					           ➢ The controls attribute is necessary to add controls to the audio/video.

					               like
					                     play 

					                     pause,

								         volume 

								                       .  


						This gives you the ability to control the video and audio content.



			          ---:source Tag:---


			               <source> element is used to serve the same media content in multiple

                            formats so that different browsers can run any of the file that it supports.

                             It is an empty element.


                      --:src Attribute:-- 

		                      The src attribute is used to specify the URL of the media file that is needed 

		                      to be played. 

		                      This can have absolute or relative path.


		                ----:type Attribute:---


		                The type attribute is used to specify the media type of the media resource. 

		                The way we define a type for video is 

		                                 like: video/mp4, etc. 


		                                   and for audio
                                                      like: audio/mpeg






     ----:figure Element:----



                     The <figure> is a new tag introduces in HTML5. 

                      This element specifies self- contained content, 

                             like 

                                  illustrations 

                                   diagrams 

                                   photos 

                                   code listings, etc. 

                                 Eg:
										<figure>
										<img src="images/logo.png" alt="The Pulpit Rock" width="304"
										height="228">
										<figcaption>Fig.1 - Trulli, Puglia, Italy.</figcaption>
										</figure>

       

          ----:figcaption Element:---
							
							The <figcaption> tag defines a caption for a <figure> element.

							 This can be  placed anywhere inside the figure element.
