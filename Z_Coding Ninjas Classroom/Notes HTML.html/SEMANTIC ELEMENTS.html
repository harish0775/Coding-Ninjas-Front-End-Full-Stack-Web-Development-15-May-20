         <--------------- <SEMANTIC ELEMENTS ---------------->





         ➢ 	Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page 
                 rather than just presentation. 
                 
                  eg.  

                     <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. 

        ➢  Semantic HTML tags provide information about the contents of those tags that goes beyond
                  just how they look on a page.

                  eg. 

			            text that is enclosed in the <code> tag is immediately
				                      recognized by the browser as some type of coding language.

					 Examples of non-semantic elements:

					           <div> and <span> - tells nothing about its content. 

					 Examples of semantic elements: 

					            <h1> to <h6>, <p>, and <ul> - clearly defines its content.

					             Now, here is an example of how some of the common semantic tags are used to construct a page:
				
				 <header></header>
						<nav></nav>
							<section></section>
							    <article></article>
							       <aside></aside>
							          <footer></footer>
