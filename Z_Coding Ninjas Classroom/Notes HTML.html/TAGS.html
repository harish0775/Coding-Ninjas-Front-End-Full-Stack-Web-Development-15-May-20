                                 <Tags>


Tags define all elements of the document, i.e. they give meaning to the plain text of HTML. 
● HTML tags are surrounded by the two characters < and > (They are called anglebrackets).

● The tag name can either start from an alphabet or an underscore(_). ● The text between the start and end tags is the element content. 
● Tags with an opening and closing can have any number of tags within itself.

● HTML tags are not case sensitive, <p> means the same as <P>. 

● HTML tags normally comes in pairs(container tags), i.e. both opening and closing(it is same, just the name    
     of the tag with character '/ ' in the beginning) tag. 

● Eg: <html> and </html> is a tag that comes in pair. 

● Eg: <br> does not have a closing tag.

● starting tag <html>
● end tag or  closed tag </html>
