*  The DOCTYPE declaration describes what version of HTML the page is written in. 

*  It is the very first thing in your HTML document that you see in every web page. It is written at the
*  top of every page before the <html> tag. The doctype declaration is not an HTML tag. 

*  It is the one recommended by HTML5.

*  The syntax for doctype is: <!DOCTYPE html>.
