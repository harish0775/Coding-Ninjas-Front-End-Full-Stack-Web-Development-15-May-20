              ● Tables are used to show the tabular data. To achieve this many tags are used. 

              ● All the table- data is enclosed within the <table> tags. 

              ● A table is divided into rows (with the <tr> tag).

              ● Each row is divided into data cells (with the <td> tag).

		      ●  tr stands for table row, which represents the row of a table.

		      ● td stands for table-data, which is the content of a data cell. 

		      ● A data cell can contain :-

		               text,

		               images,

		               lists, 

		               paragraphs,

		               forms,

		               horizontal rules, 

		               tables, etc.

		            create Table 
		                          Eg:
										<table border=1>
										<tr>
										<td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
										<td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
										<td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
										<td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
										<td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>Row 3, cell 1</td>
										<td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
										<td>Row 3, cell 3</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
										<td>Row 4, cell 1</td>
										<td>Row 4, cell 2</td>
										<td>Row 4, cell 3</td>
										</tr>
										</table>
 

               
             --:border Attribute :--


                 ● The border attribute is used for mentioning the thickness of the borders. 

                 ● If you do not specify a border attribute the table will be displayed without any borders. 

                 ● Sometimes this can be useful, but most of the time, you want the borders to show
             

            --:Headings in a Table:--


                 If you want to add column names, then HTML provides a separate tag for that. 
                 Headings in a table are defined with the <th> tag.
                       

                        <th> table heading.

                    Eg:
							<table border=1>
							<tr>
							<th>Column 1</th>
							<th>Column 2</th>
							<th>Column 3</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
							<td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
							<td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
							<td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
							<td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
							<td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
							<td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
							</tr>
							</table>



   -----:<thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>:----



   	                 ● The <thead> tag is used to group header content in an HTML table.

   	                 ● The <tbody> tag is used to group the body content in an HTML table.

   	                 ● The <tfoot> tag is used to group footer content in an HTML table.

   	                 ● These are the semantic tags that not only provide meaning to the elements but also
                       have some other useful functionality as well.
						
				     ● Browsers can use these elements to enable scrolling of the table body
						independently of the header and footer. Also, 

					 ●  when printing a large table that spans multiple pages, these elements can enable    
					     the table header and footer to be printed at the top and bottom of each page.
						

						 Eg:
									<table border="1">
										<thead>
											<tr>
												<th>Column 1</th>
												<th>Column 2</th>
												<th>Column 3 </th>
											</tr>
										</thead>
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
												<td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
												<td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
												<td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
												<td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
											</tr>
										</tbody>
										<tfoot>
											<tr>
												<th>Column 1</th>
												<th>Column 2</th>
												<th>Column 3 </th>
											</tr>
										</tfoot>
									</table>
								




		---: caption Tag :---



		          ● The <caption> tag defines a table caption.

		          ● The <caption> tag must be inserted immediately after the <table> tag.

		           Eg:

		            If you add 


		                    <caption>Table Example</caption> 
		                        just after the  
		                               <table> tag.




               NOTE: 

                     You can specify only one caption per table


     ----:. colspan and rowspan Attribute:--

			   To manage the layout of the the tables,

			         ● Two attributes are used, rowspan and colspan. 

			         ● Attribute rowspan is used to mention the number of rows that a particular cell will
						be occupying.
					 ● Attribute colspan is used to mention the number of columns that a
						particular cell will be occupying.

					● They both are used with the td tag and can also be used with the th tag.


					     Eg: 

					          adding attributes colspan and rowspan to the table
						<table border="1">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>Column 1</th>
									<th colspan="2">Column 2 and 3 heading</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
								<td colspan="2">(Row 1, cell 2) and (Row 1, cell 3)</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td rowspan="2">(Row 2, cell 1) and (Row 3, cell 2)</td>
								<td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
								<td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Row 3, cell 2</td>
								<td>Row 3, cell 3</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					   </table>
