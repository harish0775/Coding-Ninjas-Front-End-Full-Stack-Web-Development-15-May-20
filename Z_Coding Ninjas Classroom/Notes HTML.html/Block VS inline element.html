         <------Block vs Inline element--->

			--> Block elements are those that take up the full width available on a web page, 

			    effectively blocking out any other elements from sitting next to it on the left or right.

			--> Inline elements are those who only take up as much width as much needed to display the

			contents of the element, thereby allowing other elements to be in line with the inline

			element. Block elements always start on a new line. Inline elements does not start from a new line.

			Examples of block elements are 

			       <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <nav>, etc.

			 Examples of inline elements are <b>, <i>, <span>, <img>, etc.



			  NOTE:
			         You can also check which elements are block and which are inline by inspecting them
			         using chrome dev tools.
