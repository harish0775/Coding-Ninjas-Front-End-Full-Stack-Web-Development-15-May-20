           ●  With HTML you can also display images in a document.

           ●  In HTML, images are defined with the  <img> tag
           . 
           ● To display an image on a page, you need to use the src attribute.

           ●  Src stands for "source".

           ● The value of the src attribute is the URL of image you want to display on your page. 

           ● The syntax of defining an image:

                             <img src="images/logo.png">

                       The image will now be displayed on the page.

	       ● <img> tag is a self closing tag which means that it doesn't contain the closing tag.

	       ● The src tag can contain both relative and absolute paths, as well as internet image links.




	          -: The ALT Attribute:-

							● The alt attribute or alternate text tells the reader what he or she is missing on a page if the browser can't load images. 

							● The browser will then display the alternatem text instead of the image.

							● Now, we can use the alt attribute as:
						        <img src="images/logo.png" alt="Coding Ninjas image">
						     

				NOTE: 


						    It is a good practice to include the "alt" attribute for each image on a page
