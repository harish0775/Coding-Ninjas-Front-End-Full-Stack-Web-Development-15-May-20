	➢  The <a> tag defines a hyperlink,

	➢  Is used to link from one page to another. 

	➢  You have seen that clicking on a link opens a new page may be on the same page or another.

	➢ These web pages are connected using links. 

	➢ They give us the ability to go to a different web page without each time entering its URL.

	    This kind of links are external links 
	    i.e. they help in connecting to external web pages.

	     Links can also be internal which means that they will be linking the content within the same
	page. Eg:
	 link to the top of the page or any link to any specific content on the page.

	  By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

	● An unvisited link is underlined and blue

	● A visited link is underlined and purple

	● An active link is underlined and red




	         -:href Attribute:-


						   ➢ The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which
					                 indicates the link's destination. 
					       ➢ the href attribute is used to address the document.


					       Eg:

								<h2>A Great place to practice coding</h2>
								<p> Take daily challenges at

								<a href="http://www.codingninjas.in/students/assignments">Coding ninjas</a>.

								<!-- clickable content for the link is mentioned here -->
								<!-- any html element can be included here like image, gif, etc. -->
								</p>

								You will see this:

								An anchor can point to any resource on the Web: an HTML page, an image, a sound	file, a movie, etc. 

								These all are known as external links. 

					NOTE:

					            You need to remember that here also, we can provide relative url of a file as

								a value to href attribute. Eg: href="/home/myPC/Documents/test.html"





	-:Relative and Absolute Linking:-



						●  Relative linking is used to specify local links, 

						      i.e. link to files inside the root folder. 

						●  Absolute linking is used to specify outside links, 

						        i.e. URL of the web pages.


					Relative links works relative to the page. So, when a user clicks a relative link, the
					browser looks for the location of the file relative to the current page. 



		     	Four situation arises in this case:- 

						● File is present in the same folder :-

							    In this case, the name of the file is provided.  

							    Eg: 
						        	<a href="relativeFile.html">Click Me</a>,

						        	 will look for the file inside the same folder.

						● File is present in the subfolder :-

							        In this case, the name of the file provided is		
							        			preceded with the folder names according to hierarchy. 


							        			Eg: <a href="subfolder/down/relativeFile.html">Click Me</a>

							 will move to the'subfolder' folder, then to 'down' folder and look for the file inside it. 

						● File is present somewhere in the parent folder :- 

						        In this case, to move one folder above use '../'.

						           Eg:

						                <a href="../relativeFile.html">Click Me</a>


							 will move to the parent folder and look for the file inside it. 

						● File is present in another subfolder of parent folder :-

						    This case covers above two cases :-

						      Eg: 

						          <a href="../subfolder/relativeFile.html">Click Me</a>


						    will move to the parent folder, then to folder named 'subfolder'   and look 
						     for the file inside it. 

						    Absolute links provides complete web address of the web page 
						    where you want to go. 
							
							Eg: 

							      <a href="https://www.codingninjas.in/">Click Me</a>

							       will make the browser directly go to the specified URL.






     --: target Attribute:--


        With the target attribute, 
           you can define where the linked document will be opened.


         ➢ The target attribute has the following values:

							  ● _self: 
							         load the URL into the current tab itself. This is the default.\\

							  ● _blank: 
							          load the URL into a new tab or browser window. 

							  ● _parent: 
							          load the URL into the parent browsing context. If there is no parent, this behaves same as _self. 

							  ● _top:
							           load the URL into the top-level browsing context. If there is no parent, this behaves same as _self. The line below will open the document in a new browser window:

		<a href="http://www.codingninjas.in/students/assignments" target="_blank">Coding Ninjas</a>


					NOTE:

					         By default, linked page will be displayed in the current browser window.
