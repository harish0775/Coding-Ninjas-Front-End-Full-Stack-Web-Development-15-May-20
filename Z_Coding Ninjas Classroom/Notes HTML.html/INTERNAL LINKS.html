					Instead of having to resort to the task of scrolling down long pages, you can make your

					readers very happy by offering them page jumps as an alternative mode of transport around

					your site. Basically, page jumps are just links (they use the same <a> element as all

					 links), but links that point to a certain part of the same document, i.e. internal

					  links. You simply add a unique id value to an existing element. Now, you will know 

					  about id attribute afterwards in CSS, so don't stress too much on it for now. 

					  eg., here's how you set up a link:


									<h2 id="heading">This is the top</h2>
									…….
									…….
									<a href="#heading">Go to top</a>


					Explanation: In the href attribute, heading is the id of the heading of this page.

					 id of an html element is an attribute and it can have any value.

					  an id, '#' is used in the beginning of its name.

					 Clicking on the link shown below will scroll
					 
					you to the heading such that it is the first line of the display.
