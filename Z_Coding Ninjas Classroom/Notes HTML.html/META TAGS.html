			 ●  Metadata defines information about data. 

			 ● Therefore, under the meta tag, information about the web page is stored. 

			 ● Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but will be machine parsable.

			 ● The meta tag is a self-closing tag and the data stored in it is known as metadata.

			      Meta elements are typically used to specify page:-

					           description 

					           keywords

					           author of the  document 

					           last modified 

					            other metadata.


			    There are 4 attributes that are used in meta tag:

						● name

						● content

						● charset
 
						● http-equiv




					➢ Meta tags have been one of the most basic elements of SEO. 

					➢ They are used to provide details about your site to search engines.

					➢ Search engine optimization (SEO) is defined as the
					      process of affecting the online visibility of a website or a web page in a web 
					         search engine's results. 
					➢ Search engines such as Google often display the meta description in search results 

					➢ where they can highly affect user visits to website.
					    So, it’s very important to add meta tags to your web pages. 

					 NOTE:

					      There can be any number of meta tags defined within a page inside head. 





		----name Attribute:----

				➢ The name attribute is used to specify the name for the metadata. 

				➢ The name attribute is used together with content attribute. 

				➢ This attribute specifies a name for the information/value of the content attribute.

			  

			   The name attribute can have one of the 6 values:

						● author - specifies the name of the author of the document

						● keywords - specifies a comma-separated list of words for SEO purposes

						● viewport - specifies the control of the viewport on different devices

						● application-name - specifies name of the application that the page represents

						● description - specifies a description of the page

						● generator - specifies the software packages used to generate the document

				The syntax is: 

				                    <meta name="value">

		NOTE:

				 If the http-equiv attribute is set, the name attribute should not be set. SEO is
				used by the search engines like google and bing to search for the website's
				content relevant to the user search. This increases the quality and quantity of
				traffic on one's website.




		----:content Attribute:----


			   The content attribute gives the value associated with the http-equiv or name attribute. 

			     The syntax is: 

			         <meta http-equiv/content="value" content="text">
		

		 ---: charset Attribute :---

					The charset attribute is used for declaring the character encoding for the page. 
					It is a good practice to use UTF-8 encoding. However, this must be taken care of that
					the declared character set matches the one on the page and is defined for every
					page of the website. 

					The syntax is: 

					      <meta charset="character_set">
		

		----: http-equiv Attribute :---


					The http-equiv attribute provides an HTTP header for the information/value of the
					content attribute.

					 The value of this attribute can be used to alter servers and user- agents behavior. 

					 The syntax is:
					            <meta http-equiv="content-type|default-style|refresh">
					

			

			Eg.

					 the "refresh" value is used to specify the seconds after which the page is going
					   to be refreshed. 

					And if along with the time, a url is mentioned as;url=https://www.codingninjas.in/', then after 5 seconds, the user would be redirected to the mentioned URL.
