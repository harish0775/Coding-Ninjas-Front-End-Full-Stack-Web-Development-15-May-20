         <------------------<Forms>-------------------->


         ● 	HTML Forms are used to collect different kinds of user input.

         ●  Through these forms, a user enters the data which is either processed by the browse
               itself (using Javascript) or the data goes to the servers where it gets processed.

         ●   A form is an area that can contain form elements. 

         ●   A form is defined with the <form> tag. 

         ●  Form elements are elements that allow the user to enter information.

         
            --:  like  :--
			                 text 

			                 fields

			                 textarea 

			                 fields,

			                 drop- down menus, 

			                 radio buttons,

			                 checkboxes etc.

        ● An HTML form may contain a lot of elements.

            --:  like  :--

                       text fields (single line or multiline)

                       select

					   boxes

					   buttons

					   checkboxes, or radio buttons.




					--:  Let us start with just a basic form without any elements:   :--


                           Eg:
								<form action="/action_page.php">
									<label for="fname">First name:</label><br/>
									<input type="text" id="fname" name="firstname">
										<br/>
											Last name:
										<br/>
										<input type="text" name="lastname">
										<br/><br/>
									<input type="submit" value="Submit">
								</form>
                  

            


      --: Input Tage:--
                         
                         There are three attribute:-

	                                  --: type Attribute :--
	                                  --: Value Attribute:--
	                                  --: name Attribute :--


	          ●  The <input> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data. 
	          ●  <input> elements are used within a <form> element to declare input controls that
               allow users to input data. 

                   This is an inline tag.


               --: type Attribute :--

								HTML provides different types of input that you can use for different types
								    of entries. 

								By default the value of type is "text", 

								which specifies that we	want single line text input. 

								Some more values for type attribute are-
												
												email 

												password 

												date number

												range 

												url 

												radio 

												hidden

												time range

					type="submit" represents a button that when selected will submit the form.


					You can control the text that appears on the submit button with the	value attribute.

					      
					      Eg:


					                <input type="submit" value="Submit">

					                will create a button like this - 


                          NOTE:  


                                  type attribute is mandatory.   


							                                                EXTRA:
																				You can see other types from this link:
																				https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input
             

              --: Value Attribute:--


                    ➢  Value is not a compulsory attribute to add to input element, 
                        but it is very useful. 

                    ➢ The value attribute is used differently for different input types:


								● For "button", "reset", and "submit"  

								      - it defines the text on the button

								● For "text", "password", and "hidden" 

								       - it defines the initial (default) value of the input field

								● For "checkbox", "radio", "image" 

								       - it defines the value associated


								with the input (this is also the value that is sent on submit)

								Eg.
								      to display country as default initial value in an input field
								        the code willbe like this:

						                  	<input type="text" value="India" />


  
              ---: name Attribute :-- 



                         ● The name attribute is a compulsory attribute for input tag in a form. 

                         ● Without this attribute, this form element won't be submitted or in other
                               words would not be send to the server.
                        
                         ● The name attribute also uniquely identifies that piece of data. The value of
                               the input is accessed using the name attribute.




    --:label Tag:--


			    ● Use of labels to describe the kind of input in a form is not compulsory. 

			    ● You can do that without the use of label tag, as also shown in above example.

			    ●  But it is best to use <label> tag to describe the kind of input for form element. 

			    ● It not only is semantically correct but it can also be tied to their form elements 

			       like
				          <input>, <textarea>, etc.
				
				     This is also an inline tag. 

				         Like what we have done in the above example is:
									<label for="fname">First name:</label><br/>
									<input type="text" id="fname" name="firstname" />

				The label is tied to this input element by giving "id" attribute of input element the
				same value as the label's "for" attribute. 

				NOTE: 
				          It is possible for the value of id and name to be same and most of the time
                          this will be the case.




  ----:required Attribute :---

					● When present, it specifies that an input field. 

					● field must be filled out before submitting the form. 

					● Else, it shows a pop up to fill out the required field. 

			        ● The required attribute is a boolean attribute. 

					   Eg. 

					        applying required attribute to an input field 

					        like :-

								<form>
										<input type="text" required>
										<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
								</form>
					will show an error, when clicked on Submit button as shown in image below:
	


-----:placeholder Attribute:---


					● The placeholder attribute is used with input element.  

				    ●  It describes a sample value or a short description of the expected format. 

				    ●  The value of the placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the
					     expected value of an input field. 

					 Eg.

					   adding placeholder to the input


							<input type="text" name="fname" placeholder="First name"><br>

							<input type="text" name="lname" placeholder="Last name">
					

----:disabled Attribute:----

            ● The disabled attribute specifies that the <input> element should be disabled. 

            ● If the input is disabled, it becomes un-editable and un-clickable, although it might already
               contain a default value in it.

            ●  This is also a boolean attribute. 

            Eg. 

                adding disabled attribute to an input element

                 <input type="text" name="country" value="India" disabled><br>

            NOTE: 
 
                   Disabled <input> elements in a form will not be submitted



-----:Checkboxes:----

          ● checkbox is a value of type attribute of input element. 

          ●  Check boxes are used when more than one option may need to be checked or you can also it 
              to enable or disable something. The checkbox is shown as a square box that 
              is ticked (checked) when activated. There is also a attribute named checked,
               that when present makes the checkbox


             selected by default when page loads. 

             Eg:
					<form>
					<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle1" value="Bike"> I have a bike<br>
					<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle2" value="Car"> I have a car<br>
					<input type="checkbox" name="vehicle3" value="Boat" checked> I have a
					boat
					</form>


----:Radio Button:---

            ● Radio button is just like a checkbox, but the difference is that 
              the values of name attribute are all the same. 

            ● To define a radio button the value of type attribute is "radio". 

            ● The name attributes are all set to the same value makes these radio buttons part of
                 the same set, and therefore, you can only select one of them at once.
						Eg:
								<form action="/action_page.php">
										<input type="radio" name="gender" value="male" checked> Male<br>
										<input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female<br>
										<input type="radio" name="gender" value="other"> Other
								</form>






---:fieldset and legend Elements:-----

                            
         ● The <fieldset> element is used to provide grouping for a part of an HTML form. 

         ● The <fieldset> tag draws a box around the related elements, which makes it more
            presentable. 

         ● The <legend> element is used for providing a title or explanatory caption for the
				rest of the contents of the legend element's parent element.
		 ●  <legend> comes just  after the <fieldset> tag. Eg, if a fieldset and legend is used
				<form>
				        <fieldset>
						 <legend>SUBSCRIBE:</legend>
							Name: <input type="text"><br>
							Email: <input type="text"><br>
						</fieldset>
				</form>
			



------:select Element:---------


			● HTML <select> tag is used to create drop down list of options. 

			● Drop down list contains many options and the user can choose one of them. 

			● The select tag also contains name attribute, 
		    	like  
			        other form elements,

			           that represent the associated data submitted to the server. 

			●  There are some of the unique attributes of 
			    select element- 

			      ● multiple
			           which specifies that multiple options can be selected.

			      ● size  

			           which specifies how many options can be shown at once.

			            Eg:
								<select name="select">
								<option value="value1">Value 1</option>
								<option value="value2" selected>Value 2</option>
								<option value="value3">Value 3</option>
								</select>
								Will show a dropdown like this:
								and on clicking the above option will open other options as:




			      ---:option Element:---

			             ● The tag used to define the possible options is <option> tag. 

			             ● This tag is put inside the <select> tag. 

			            	For every option in drop down list, separate <option> element is used.

						 ● The first <option> element from the options' list is selected by default. 

					     ● To change this predefined option, use selected attribute with the <option> tag. 

					     ● Each option element should have a value attribute, which contains the
						data value that will be submitted to the server when that option is selected
                      

                   ----: optgroup Element :---

								● The <optgroup> tag is used to group several options together into one
								group.

								● This will create separate groups of options inside the dropdown.

								 Eg:
								<select>
									<optgroup label="Books">
									<option value="html">HTML</option>
									<option value="css">CSS</option>
									</optgroup>
									<optgroup label="Snippets">
									<option value="git">Git</option>
									<option value="java">Java</option>
									</optgroup>
								</select>




 ----:textarea Element:----

       ● The <textarea> element is a input element where the user can input multi-line
           text, unlike <input> element where there is only a single line.
          
        ● A text area can hold unlimited number of characters, and text wrapping is allowed
           
            when the form is submitted. 
               Eg:
					<label>Write about yourself:</label>
					<textarea rows="10" cols="50"></textarea>


					---:rows and cols Attribute:----

									
									These 2 attributes are used to set the size of <textarea>. 
									
									The rows attribute specifies the visible height of a text area. 
									
									The cols attribute specifies the visible width of a text area.

				NOTE:     

						   The size of text area can also be specified by CSS height and width
									property





-----: Submit Button :-----
  
			➢  Submit button is a button that when clicked automatically submits the form. 

	    	➢  The button is defined at the end of the form. 

			    There are 2 different ways to add submit button to the form:

							● via <input> tag
							● via <button> tag

			Both these ways will work in the same way.



			        ---: via input tag  :----


					          ● The <input> tag can also be used to create a button. 

					          ● To use it as a button, the type attribute is set to value submit.

					          When the click event occurs, 

					             i.e. 

					                 the user clicks on the button, the form gets submitted. 

					           ● The input tag is a self closing tag, 
					                so the value of button is set by the value 	attribute.

								  The submit button can be formed using the input tag as:

										<input type="button" value="Submit form">

										this will display the button as:
                        
                     ---: via submit tag :----

                        ●  The <button> is also used to create submit button in form. 

                        ●  Although, the <input> tag also creates a submit button, 
                           but there are some benefits of button tag over input tag. 

                        ● The button tag is a container tag and therefore, can contain other tags.

                        ●  This helps in adding images and other contents in the button.

                        ●  The button has to set the type attribute to submit value, to make it a
                               submit button.

                             Eg., 

                                 the submit button with an image can be defined as:
										<button type="submit">
										<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Learn HTML" height="20"
										width="40"/> Submit </button>


					  ---:autofocus Attribute:---


					     ● The autofocus attribute is a boolean attribute. 

					     ● When applied to the button specifies that the button automatically gets focus 
					         when the page loads.


					  ----:events on button:--


					      There are some events of HTML that we will cover here. 
					      Events are things that takes place when something happens with HTML elements. onclick is one such event that triggers some action when the button is
                            clicked. 


                               Eg.

                                   <button onclick="alert('Learn HTML')" >Click ME</button>

							    ➢  The alert is a window method displays an alert box with a specified
							         message and an OK button. 

							    ➢   The alert box covers the whole window screen and makes that browser    
							         unavailable to use

							       The alert box looks like this:


											Another such window method is location.

											        href, that creates an HTML

											button that acts like a link. So, when it is clicked, it redirects to a page. 
											The value of location.href contains the URL you want to redirect it to. 

						      Eg.					

								<button onclick="location.href='http://google.com';" >Click	ME</button>




    ----:Submitting the form:-----


		➢  When the form is submitted, the page gets reloaded and we know that the form
			 gets submitted. But actually, the form input data is not being submitted to the
			 server. To get the form to send the input data to the server,
			 we need to set 2 attributes in the form:

						● method attribute
						● action attribute

			    Eg.

			         the form has these attributes as:

			<form action="/address_to_handle_form" method="post"> </form>

 

                 ---: method Attribute :---


                      ➢ The method attribute defines how the form data is send. 
                      ➢ The data can be send in different ways to the server. 
                      ➢ There is mainly 2 values we use to send the data:

							● get 
							      - this appends the data into the url with '?'
							            as separator in name- value pairs. 

							        Since this data will be visible, so sensitive data

							         (like password) should not be send. 
							           This can be used to send query strings
							
							          like: URL?name=value&name=value
							
							● post 

							    - this appends the data inside the body of the HTTP request.

							      The post is used to send the sensitive data


			  ---:action Attribute:---
    

							➢ The action attribute defines where the form data is send when form is
							submitted. 

							➢ This contains the address (i.e. URL) of the file where the data is
							send. 

							➢ The URL can be provided in absolute and relative path. The absolute URL points to another web site (like action="http://www.xyz.com/example.html"). 

							➢ The relative URL points to a file within the web site 
							   (like action="/example.html")
