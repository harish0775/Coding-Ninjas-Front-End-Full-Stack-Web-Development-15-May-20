         <----------Margin------------>

			The CSS margin properties are used to create space between the borders and the other
			surrounding elements.

			 You can also provide negative margins as well. 



     There are two other values that are used for the margin:


			auto - the margin is applied by the browser itself only to horizontal margins

			none - to remove any margins from the element or makes the value of margin equal to zero


			Just like the border property, you can provide margins separately to the sides. The margin
	

	property for the sides are:
						
						● margin-top
						● margin-right
						● margin-bottom
						● margin-left
			

			Eg. 

			     <div class="blue-box"><div class="orange-box">This is div</div></div>

		     following CSS to the code: 
					        .blue-box {
										border: 3px solid black;
										background-color: skyblue;
										}
						
									.orange-box {
												border: 1px solid black;
												margin:25px 50px;
												text-align: center;
												background-color: orange;
												}

			
		

		NOTE:

			 When two elements are positioned vertically, then the top and bottom margins of
			elements are collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two
			margins. Margin can contain negative values.
