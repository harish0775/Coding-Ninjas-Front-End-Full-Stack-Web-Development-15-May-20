 <------Absolute Units------->


              The absolute units a fixed size/length of the element. 

              Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen 
                     because screen sizes vary so much. 

               The absolute units consist of the following:

								● cm - centimeters
								● mm - millimeters in inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
								● px - pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
								● pt - points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
								● pc - picas (1pc = 12 pt)

     






 


  <------Relative Units----->               id {
								                position:relative;

								                }



			Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. 

			   Some of the relative units are the following:


					● em - Relative to the font-size of the element 
					               (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)

					● rem - Relative to font-size of the root element

					● vw - Relative to 1% of the width of the browser window size

					● vh - Relative to 1% of the height of the browser window size

                    ● % - Relative to the parent element
