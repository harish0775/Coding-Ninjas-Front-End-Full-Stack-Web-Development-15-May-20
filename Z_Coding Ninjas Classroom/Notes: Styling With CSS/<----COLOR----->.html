       <----COLOR----->

     
       The color property is used to set the foreground color of an element's text context and its
       decoration. 

             The color property can be specified in 6 different ways. 
             Each one of them provides has some difference from the other. 

             Although color can also be applied to backgrounds and borders, we will discuss them later. Eg. the following code:
				
				<h2 style="color:orangered;">orangered</h2>

				<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">#ff6347</h2>

				<h2 style="color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">rgb(255, 99, 71)</h2>

				<h2 style="color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.7);">rgba(64, 213, 240, 0.5)</h2>
			
				<h2 style="color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">hsl(9, 100%, 64%)</h2>

				<h2 style="color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.7);">hsla(190, 73%, 95%, 0.5)</h2>







		 ----: By name :--

				     All modern browsers support 140 different colors named in CSS.
					       
					       Unlike
					         
					         HTML
					         CSS

					will completely ignore unknown keywords. 

					The color keywords all represent plain, solid colors, without transparency.
					   
					     Eg. 

					     orangered, green, blue, lightgrey, etc.

		----: rgb :----
					
					 RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue.

					 It is a color model where combination of red, green and blue form a color.

					 The intensity of each color has value ranging from 0 to 255.

					 This provides very large number of colors dataset.

					  Eg. 
					         RGB value for :--

					             black rgb(0, 0, 0) 

					             white  rgb(255, 255,	255).


	    ---: hex code :---


					The colors can be represented by 6 digits hexadecimal code. 

					The codes are made	using the 3 colors(Red, Green and Blue). 

					First 2 digits  :--
					     First 2   red 
					     next 2    green           #RRGGBB.
					     last 2    blue.

					  So, the syntax for hex code is: #RRGGBB. 

					For each hexadecimal value between 00 - FF is similar to 0 - 255.


					      Eg. 

					        #000000 is black 
					        #FFFFFF is white.



	    ----: hsl :---                  

	                                  Hue, Saturation and Lightness


					The color can also be specified using the HSL (Hue, Saturation and Lightness)
					components. 


					  ● Hue, is a degree on the 

					            color wheel from 0 to 360. 

					                0 is red, 
					               120 is green,  
                                   240 is blue. 


                      ● Saturation, represents the amount of saturation in the color.

                       It is a	percentage value,

                           0% means a shade of gray

                           100% is the full color.

                       ● Lightness, represents the amount of light in the color.

                        It is also a percentage,

                            0% is black, 

                            50% is neither light or dark, 

                            100% is white. 


        ---: rgba :--  

                                        Red, Green, Blue, Alpha

					   RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) is an extension of RGB,

					   RGB provided with alpha transparency. 

					   This alpha value determines the opacity of the RGB defined color.

					   The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (transparent) and 1.0 (opaque).  

					      Eg.

					      rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.6) is a red color, with 0.6 opacity will have the color:
	 



	   ---:  hsla :-- 	                
	                                Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha


					HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha) is also an extension of HSL.

					HSlA  provided with  alpha transparency. 

					The alpha value and property is same as that in RGBA. 

					    Eg.


			hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.6) is also a red color with 0.6 opacity and have same color:
