   CSS units are used for expressing size of different properties. 

             The units are expressed by a number followed by the unit symbol. 

            Many CSS properties take "length" values, 

               such :--


                    width
                    margin
                    padding
                    font-size
                    border-width, etc. 


              Eg. are 10px, 2em, 50% etc.



					A whitespace cannot appear between the number and the unit.

					If the value is 0, the unit can be omitted. 




                 	For some CSS properties, negative lengths are allowed. Eg. marg
