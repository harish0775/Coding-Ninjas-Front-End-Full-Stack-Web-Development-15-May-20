            The position property is for specifying the positioning of element on the page.
            
             This fixes the position of element relative to web page or parent element.
             
              The position property provides 5 ways to position the element
								

									● static - default
									● relative
									● absolute
									● fixed
									● sticky


                        This property is not enough to manipulate the position of the element. The position property just specifies the behaviour.

                         Therefore, to move the elements 

                 

        we have these 4 properties:


						● left - shifts the element with respect to the left side of the element
						
						● right - shifts the element with respect to the right side of the element
						
						● top - shifts the element with respect to the top side of the element
						
						● bottom - shifts the element with respect to the bottom side of the element

				The above properties, 

				    i.e.

				          left 

				          right 

				           top 

				           bottom


   have numerical values in both relative and absolute units. 

        The value can be both positive and negative. 

        They also work differently depending on the position value. 

        Eg.   
            for the layout like this:

								<div class="outer">
								  <h2>POSITION property</h2>
								      <span class="inner">This is relative to viewport</span>
								</div>


					and making div’s position relative with css code like: 

					.outer {
								position: relative;
								width: 250px;
								height: 150px;
								border: 1px solid red;
								padding: 10px;
						}
				      .inner {
								border: 1px solid blue;
								padding: 5px;
								top: 10px;
								left: 40px;
					  }



---: static :---

				The static value positions the element according to the normal flow of the page
				   and not in any special way. 

				 This is the default property.

				 Properties like:- 
				      top 

				      right 

				       bottom 

				       left  
				              do not work when this is used.

				        You can alternatively use position: static; 

				        to apply this property and the layout will look same. 
		


-----:relative:----



				The relative value positions the element relative to its first positioned 
				(i.e. not static) ancestor element. It is similar to the static value, but now the properties like
				top, right, bottom, left will work on the element. The original position of the element remains occupied. Use position: relative; to apply this property and the layout will look like this:
				9.3. absolute
				The absolute value positions the element relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
				If there is no positioned ancestor, then the position would be relative browser's
				window. The element doesn't occupy its original space. Use position: absolute; to apply this property and the layout will look like this:
				9.4. fixed
				The fixed value fixes the position of the element relative to the viewport, which
				means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. Also, the element does not leave a gap in the page, i.e. it will overlap with other
				element. Use position: fixed; to apply this property and the layout will look like this:
				Notice, the ending of black line is the start of the web page and the distance
				between the black line and the <span> is 10px. 9.5. sticky
				The sticky value is initially positioned as in the HTML source. It is then fixed
				relative to the viewport as soon as it reaches the desired position. A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll
				position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed). Use position: sticky; to apply this property and the layout initially be same as
				that of relative positioned and moves with the page on scrolling until the final
				position (i.e. same as fixed position) is reached. 




				10. BOX MODEL
Box model describes the layout of the elements. The HTML elements are considered as
boxes. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists
of: margins, borders, padding, and content. The image below illustrates the box model:
The total width of the element is equal to the total of the horizontal margin, border and
padding, and content width of element. The total height of the element is equal to the total of the horizontal margin, border and
padding, and content height of element. 11. MIN/MAX WIDTH
Width property is used to set the width of the element, to a specific size. But the size of the
becomes fixed with this and this brings problem of in smaller devices. The browser then gets
a scrollbar to scroll through the entire content. So, to overcome this problem, CSS provides max-width property. This specifies the
maximum width that an element can have. If the browser window's width becomes smaller
than the width of the element, the element width adjusts with the browser width. But, a very small element is very difficult to read. So, another property min-width is
provided by the CSS that specifies the minimum width that the element can have.
Eg., we have two divs like this:
<div id="div1">
<div id="div2">This example shows how the max and min width property
works.</div>
</div>
and the CSS is applied to them:
#div1{
background-color:lightgrey;
}
#div2 {
max-width: 400px;
min-width:300px;
}
will show like this when the browser width is more than 400px:
and like this when the browser width is less than 300px:
12. OVERFLOW
The overflow property is used to specify what happens if the content of an element
overflows, i.e. the content’s height or width is larger than element’s height or width. This property adds a scroll-bar or clips the content when an element's content is too big to
fit in a specified area. The values that the overflow property can take are:
● visible -this is default value. The content overflows and seen outside the box
● hidden - only the content that fits inside the box is visible and the overflow is
clipped
● scroll - all the content is visible through a scroll-bar added to the box
● auto - a scroll-bar gets added if content overflows
Eg., when we a larger content than that can be fitted inside the element like:
<div>HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. Basically, it’s the “code” behind
every webpage – even this one. If you’re just beginning to learn HTML, let us tell
you that it’s a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can’t do anything more
than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating frames – but it is handy as it
helps you structure the content correctly, which is important when you sit down to
add style to your HTML.</div>
with fixed height and width as:
div {
background-color: aliceblue;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
overflow: scroll;
}
will show the box in the browser like this:
NOTE: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height
