         The background properties are used to define the background effects for elements. 

         The background of an element is the total size of the element and includes padding and border but not the margin.



                      :----  background(total size include): padding,border  :----




         Backgrounds can be filled with a color or image, clipped or resized, and otherwise modified. 


         CSS background properties:
							

								● background-image
								● background-repeat
								● background-position
								● background-size
								● background-attachment


		Eg.
					 the below CSS code when applied to a web page
				

					body {
							background-image: url("https://blog.codingninjas.in/wpcontent/uploads/2017/01/cropped-Final_logo_switchtocode-01.png"), lineargradient(#a3f7ff, #fff58e);

							background-repeat: repeat-x;

							background-position: center center;

							background-attachment: fixed;
					}
					

					NOTE:

					     You can see about other background properties from

<-----background-color----->



			The background-color property sets the background color of an element.

			 It has the	same value as that of the color property. 

			 Eg.
			      <p style="background-color: #afcbff;"> 

			      	Don’t you just love exploring
			beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us would
			reply with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know.
			      </p>




<------background-image---->



			         The background-image property is used to specify an image to use as the
			background of an element. 

			This can set one or more background images for an element. 

			By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an element, and is repeated so it covers the entire element both vertically and horizontally. 


	The values it can take are:


			● url('URL') - specifies the URL of the image. You can specify more than one
			image by separating the URLs with a comma

			● none - this is default value. No background image will be displayed

			● linear-gradient() - sets a linear gradient as the background image. At least two
			colors needed to be mentioned (default direction is top to bottom)

			● radial-gradient() - sets a radial gradient as the background image. At least two
			colors needed to be mentioned (default is from center to edges)

			● repeating-linear-gradient() - repeats a linear gradient

			● repeating-radial-gradient() - repeats a radial gradient
			In the above example, we are using both the image and linear-gradient together. Try to swap the sequence of image and gradient and see what happens.






<-----background-repeat----->

         

			The background-repeat property is used to specify how/if a background image will
			be repeated. 

			By default, a background image repeats both vertically and horizontally, so
			background-repeat will how will the image repetition works. 


	The values this property can take are:


			● repeat - this is default value. The background image is repeated both vertically
			and horizontally. The last image will be clipped if it does not fit
			
			● repeat-x - the image is repeated only horizontally
			
			● repeat-y - the image is repeated only vertically
			
			● no-repeat - the image will only be shown once
			
			● space - the background-image is repeated without clipping. The space
			remaining is distributed evenly between images with first and last images
			pinned to sides of the element
			
			● round - the image is repeated and shrink or stretch to fill the space.








<----background-position--->


      ● The background-position property is used to specify the initial position of a
        background image.

	 ●  By default, a background image is placed at the top-left corner of an element and
		you can change the position with background-position property. 

	 ●   The values this property can take are(X represents horizontal position and Y
		represents vertical position):

	 ●   X Y - they both can each take value from one of the following

	    - left, right, top, bottom, center.

	     If one value is specified, the other value will be "center" 

	 ● Xpos Ypos - specifies the horizontal and vertical position relative to the
		   viewport. 

		Units can be any of the CSS units. If you only specify one value, the
		other value will be 50%.





<-----background-size---->




        The background-size property is used to specify the size of the background images. 


       
       The values it can take are:
			
			● auto - this is a default value. The image is displayed in its original size
			
			● length - sets the width and height of the background image. The first value
			sets the width, the second value sets the height

			● percentage - sets the width and height of the background image in percent. The first value sets the width, the second value sets the height. 

			      If only one
			           value is given, the second is set to "auto" 

			● cover - resizes the background image to cover horizontal width of container

			● contain - resizes the background image to make sure the image is fully visible





<------background-attachment----->


	 The background-attachment property is used to specify whether a background
	 image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed. 




	The values it can take are:


			● scroll - this is default value. The background image will scroll with the page
			
			● fixed - the background image will not scroll with the page
			
			● local - the background image will scroll with the element's contents
