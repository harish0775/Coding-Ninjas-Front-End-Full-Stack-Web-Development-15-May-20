              The display property is a very important CSS property for controlling layout. 

              It specifies if/how an element is displayed.

              Many of the elements have default display property value as inline or block 
              (inline and block elements in HTML).

       

         The display property has following values:
									

										● inline
										● block
										● inline-block
										● none




---- : Inline Display :--- 


				   When display: inline; is used these following happens to the element:
				
				● element doesn't starts in a new line
				
				● only takes up as much width as necessary, so cannot set height and width
				
				● the vertical margins do not work
				
		Eg.

		   originally a list looks like this:

				making the list inline:
							
							li { 
							     display: inline; 
						    }


	
		and the list will now be shown in a single line like this(the space before the list is
				because ul element have a default padding value):



				

-----: Block Display :----


				When display: block; is used these following happens to the element:
				
				● element starts in a new line
				
				● takes up full-width of the parent element
				
		Eg.
		      originally the 2 spans look like this:

				<span>The quick brown fox</span> <span>jumps over the lazy dog!</span>
				adding the block property to them like this:

				li { 

				display: block; 

			}
				and it will be shown like this now:
		



-----: Inline-block Display :---- 




				display: inline-block; is a combination of the properties of the inline and blockelements. 


		These are the advantages of inline-block:
				
				● height and width of the element can be set now
				
				● vertical margins are allowed
				
				● element can sit next to each other
				


		  There is a space between the elements next to each other
				




	Eg.     there are two empty div element:
								


								<div class="div"></div>
								<div class="div"></div>


				and the following properties have been applied to them: 


				.div {

					display: inline-block;
					border: 1px dashed black;
					width: 100px;
					height: 100px;
					background-color: lightgrey;
			}

				two divs will be displayed next to each other like this:

				You can notice a space between these 2 divs. It is because inline elements have a word-spacing in them and it is also a default in inline-block elements.







-----:  No Display :---- 
		

				The display:none; property hides the elements in a browser.

				 It actually removes the element from the HTML page and nothing is shown in its place. 

				     This is similar to another property 

				     - visibility:hidden;


			  . The difference is that the element is not removed from the page and still occupies the space.
