		The opacity property is used to set the transparency of an element.

		This can take a value ranging from (0.0 - 1.0).

		 The lower the value, the more transparent the element will become.

		
		So, when adding transparency to the background of an element,
		 all of its child elements also	inherit the same transparency. 
		 This makes the text inside transparent as well.


		  To provide transparency to only the background color,
		   you can use 'rgba()' property to provide color with alpha value.
