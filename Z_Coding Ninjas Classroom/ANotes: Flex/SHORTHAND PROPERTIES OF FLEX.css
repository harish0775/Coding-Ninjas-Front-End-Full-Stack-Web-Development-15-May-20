	Shorthand properties are used to combine some flex properties together, so that they can
	be defined in one line. 

     ---------:Flex Flow:----------

	The flex-flow property is a shorthand property to combine flex-direction 

	    and flex- wrap properties in one property.
	
	CSS Syntax is - flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap | initial | inherit;

	The meaning of the other 2 values is:

	● initial - represents flex-flow property as (row nowrap)
	● inherit - inherits this property from its parent element


----------: Flex :------------

	The flex property is a shorthand property to combine the flex child properties, 

	i.e. flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. 

	CSS Syntax is - flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis | auto | initial
	| none | inherit;

	The meaning of the other 4 values is:
	
	● auto - represents flex property as (1 1 auto)
	● initial - represents flex property as (0 1 auto)
	● none - represents flex property as (0 0 auto)
	● inherit - inherits this property from its parent element
